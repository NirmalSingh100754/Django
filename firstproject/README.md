## 1. Initial Django Project Setup

These are the initial commands to create the Django project and set up the environment.

### a. Create Virtual Environment
A virtual environment keeps Python package dependencies isolated.

```bash
# Create the virtual environment in a folder named .venv
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate it (macOS/Linux)
source .venv/bin/activate
# On Windows, use: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### b. Install Django and Create Project

```bash
# Install Django
pip install django

# Create the Django project in the current directory
django-admin startproject firstproject .
```

### c. Create `requirements.txt`
This file lists all Python dependencies, making the project reproducible.

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

---

## 2. Core Structure & Configuration

We created a `theme` app to manage all frontend assets and global templates.

### a. Create the `theme` App

```bash
python manage.py startapp theme
```

### b. Configure `settings.py`
Key changes were made to `firstproject/settings.py` to integrate the `theme` app and configure templates and static files.

1.  **Add `theme` to `INSTALLED_APPS`**:

    ```python
    # firstproject/settings.py
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # ... other apps
        'theme',
    ]
    ```

2.  **Configure Template Directory**: Tell Django to look for templates in a project-level `templates` directory inside our `theme` app.

    ```python
    # firstproject/settings.py
    TEMPLATES = [
        {
            # ...
            'DIRS': [BASE_DIR / 'theme/templates'],
            # ...
        },
    ]
    ```

3.  **Configure Static Files**: This setup distinguishes between source assets (`static_src`) and compiled assets (`static`).

    ```python
    # firstproject/settings.py
    STATIC_URL = 'static/'
    STATICFILES_DIRS = [
        BASE_DIR / 'theme/static',
    ]
    STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'staticfiles' # For production collectstatic
    ```

---

## 3. Frontend Setup with Tailwind CSS

We use `npm` and Tailwind CSS to manage and build our frontend assets. All frontend source code lives in `theme/static_src/`.

### a. Initialize npm

```bash
# Navigate to the source directory
cd theme/static_src

# Initialize a new npm project (the -y flag accepts all defaults)
npm init -y
```

### b. Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
# In theme/static_src/
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer cross-env rimraf postcss-import postcss-nested postcss-simple-vars @tailwindcss/aspect-ratio @tailwindcss/forms @tailwindcss/line-clamp @tailwindcss/typography
```

### c. Create Tailwind and PostCSS Configs

```bash
# In theme/static_src/
npx tailwindcss init -p
```
This creates `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`.

### d. Configure `tailwind.config.js`
We told Tailwind to scan our Django templates for CSS classes.

```javascript
// theme/static_src/tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    '../../templates/**/*.html',       // Scans all .html files in theme/templates
    '../../**/templates/**/*.html',   // Scans any other app's templates folder
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/forms'),
    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
    require('@tailwindcss/aspect-ratio'),
    require('@tailwindcss/line-clamp'),
  ],
}
```

### e. Create Source CSS File
Create `theme/static_src/src/styles.css` and add the Tailwind directives:

```css
/* theme/static_src/src/styles.css */
@import "tailwindcss/base";
@import "tailwindcss/components";
@import "tailwindcss/utilities";
```

### f. Add `npm` Scripts
Update `theme/static_src/package.json` to add build scripts. These scripts were copied from your `package.json`.

```json
// theme/static_src/package.json
"scripts": {
  "start": "npm run dev",
  "build": "npm run build:clean && npm run build:tailwind",
  "build:clean": "rimraf ../static/css/dist",
  "build:tailwind": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production tailwindcss --postcss -i ./src/styles.css -o ../static/css/dist/styles.css --minify",
  "dev": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development tailwindcss --postcss -i ./src/styles.css -o ../static/css/dist/styles.css -w"
},
```

---

## 4. Creating Templates and Views

### a. Create Base Template (`base.html`)
In `theme/templates/base.html`, we set up the main HTML structure and linked our compiled stylesheet.

```html
<!-- theme/templates/base.html -->
{% load static %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My Project</title>
    <link href="{% static 'css/dist/styles.css' %}" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body class="bg-gray-50 font-serif">
    {% block content %}{% endblock %}
</body>
</html>
```

### b. Create an Index View and URL
1.  **View (`theme/views.py`)**:
    ```python
    from django.shortcuts import render

    def index(request):
        return render(request, 'index.html')
    ```
2.  **App URLs (`theme/urls.py`)**: Create this new file.
    ```python
    from django.urls import path
    from . import views

    urlpatterns = [
        path('', views.index, name='index'),
    ]
    ```
3.  **Project URLs (`firstproject/urls.py`)**: Include the `theme` app's URLs.
    ```python
    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.urls import path, include

    urlpatterns = [
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
        path('', include('theme.urls')),
    ]
    ```

---

## 5. Development Workflow

To run the project for development, you need two terminals running simultaneously.

**Terminal 1: Run Django Server**
From the project root (`/Users/nirmalsingh/Desktop/Django/firstproject`):
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

**Terminal 2: Run Tailwind Watcher**
From the frontend source directory (`theme/static_src`):
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 7. Adding the 'nirmal' App (Chai Varity)

After the initial project and theme setup, a new app named `nirmal` was created to manage different varieties of chai.

### a. Create the `nirmal` App
A new app to handle chai-related logic was created.

```bash
python manage.py startapp nirmal
```

### b. Define the `ChaiVarity` Model
A model was created in `nirmal/models.py` to store information about each chai variety. This model includes fields for the chai's name, an image, the date it was added, and its type (e.g., Masala, Ginger).

### c. Configure `settings.py`
The project's settings were updated to recognize the new app and handle media files for the `ImageField`.

1.  **Add `nirmal` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `firstproject/settings.py`**:
    ```python
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # ... other apps
        "nirmal",
        # ...
    ]
    ```

2.  **Configure Media Root and URL**: To handle image uploads for the `ChaiVarity` model.
    ```python
    # firstproject/settings.py
    MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
    MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')
    ```

### d. Create and Apply Database Migrations
After defining the model, migrations are necessary to create the corresponding table in the database.

1.  **Create migrations for the `nirmal` app**:
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations nirmal
    ```
2.  **Apply the migrations to the database**:
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

### e. Register Model in the Django Admin
To make the `ChaiVarity` model manageable through the Django admin interface, it was registered in `nirmal/admin.py`.

### f. Create Views and URLs for the App
Basic views and URL patterns were created inside the `nirmal` app in `nirmal/views.py` and `nirmal/urls.py`.

### g. Include App URLs in Project
Finally, the `nirmal` app's URLs were included in the main `firstproject/urls.py` file, and the media URL patterns were configured for development.

```python
# firstproject/urls.py
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns = [
    # ... other urls
    path('nirmal/', include('nirmal.urls')),
] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
```
This setup ensures that any request to `/nirmal/...` is handled by the `nirmal` app and that media files are served correctly during development.
